        <strong>Nobody's</strong> born smart. We all start at 0. Can’t <em>talk</em>, can’t <em>walk</em>, certainly <strong>can't</strong> <em>do algebra</em>.<br>
        Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. Nobody’s good at anything <em>at first.</em><br>
        There was a time when <em>Einstein</em> couldn’t count to 10.<br>
        And <em>Shakespeare</em> had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.<br>
        Thankfully, we are born to learn.<br>
        Slowly. Surely. You stumble, <em>slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.</em><br>
        Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. <em>Struggling</em>.<br>
        Until one day, you walk.<br>
        One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
        Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger.<br>
        <em>Failing</em> is just another word for <strong>growing</strong>. And you keep going.<br>
        <strong>This. is. learning.</strong><br>
        It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
        You just don’t get it, yet.
        Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
        are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere can understand.<br>
        Whoever you are, wherever you are.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        You only have to know <em>one</em> thing:<br>
       <strong> You can learn anything.</strong>
